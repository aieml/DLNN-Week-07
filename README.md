# DLNN-Week-07
This week we discussed about Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory Cells, Back Propagation through time and how to apply LSTMs for time series/ sequence data. Then we implemented a simple random LSTM Neural Network to predict stock market values using a real data-set from AAPL.
